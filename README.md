# Palindrome Checker

This is a tool for checking whether a given text is a palindrome

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. "madam" or "nurses run". Our palindrome checker ignores whitespace, punctuation and special symbols so text like "00--00" and "Al lets Della call Ed Stella.” count as palindromes.

Famous Examples include:

1. Amore, Roma.
2. racecar.
3. civic.
4. Taco cat.
